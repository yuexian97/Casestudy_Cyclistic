--Update the format of the started_at and ended_at columns for aug_2020 & cyclist_trip_data as they were in the wrong format, cast function is used because without it it will select as a string instead, so we need to change the string to a timestamp format

SET started_at = CAST(FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%d%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S UTC', started_at) AS timestamp)
